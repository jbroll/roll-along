After 30 years together, we have decided to see what it's like
to live in 85 square feet of space. We sold our primary home in the
spring, and put most of our possessions in a storage unit. (We're hoping
that we won't want a lot of them by the time we get it to unpacking it.
) We moved in with the parents/in-laws and spent our summer between
their home and our summer cottage.

Years of persuading, and a global pandemic finally convinced Rachel to
jump on board John's idea of camping across the country. With our kids
living on the other side of the country, this was going to be the best
way to travel to see them. Rachel had just retired, and John is now
working remotely, so this just might work.

The camper that we finally settled on is a 16' Scamp. Camper sales have
been crazy during the time of Covid-19, and the Scamps had about an 8
month order time when we inquired at the factory (2 months later and
it's closer to a year!). Timing is everything -- someone had just
cancelled their order that morning and we were given their camper -- due
for pickup in 8 weeks!

Being a couple of homebodies, this is a real and true adventure for us.
We decided that we needed to document our trip, so a blog seemed like
the thing to do. Welcome to Roll-Along: A Travel Adventure. We
hope you enjoy following us!
